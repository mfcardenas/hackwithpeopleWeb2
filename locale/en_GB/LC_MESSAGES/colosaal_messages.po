msgstr "These technologies consist of the integration of eletrocnic elements in our daily environment, so they alow us to complement or to mantain our quality of life.

msgid "Every person is unique."
msgstr "Every person is unique. Adjusting assistive technology to every particular case is an expensive process. Industrial models are guided by large-scale production of completely equal products.

msgid "Many projects fail because they do not propose an interesting solution for those who will use it."
msgstr "Many projects fail because they do not propose an interesting solution for those who will use it. To avoid this frustration, volunteers are being included in the creation of the products. This decision raises the price, because we require facilities to test the product and compensations for the volunteers for their effort. Moreover, it poses new questions. Let's imagine that we create a fall detector: Do we ask the volunteer to fall down? Will the product detect the fall down a staircase?."
